# Project3
I created a Shiny app to analyze the student performance data and make some predictions.  
To get this started I used the following packages:    
  - shiny  
  - shinydashboard
  - DT  
  - tidyverse  
  - corrplot  
  - rgl  
  - tree  
  - caret  
  - ggplot2  
  - plotly  
  - ggcorrplot  
  - qtlcharts    

Quickly install these pacakages with:   
 ```
 install.packages(c("shiny", "shinydashboard", "DT", "tidyverse", "corrplot", "rgl", "tree", "caret", "ggplot2", "plotly", "ggcorrplot", "qtlcharts"))
 ```
 
Try it out with:   
```
runGitHub("Project3", "apolanc2", subdir = "Project3App", ref = "main")
```
Or use the file "runProject3.R"!   


Enjoy!
